## Building a K-Means Clustering Algorithm to Segment Customers of a Retail Store.

Hello people! I'm Goriola. This is a personal project in which I build a K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers of a retail store. The raw data is a csv file (Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty Scores.csv) containing information about the satisfaction and loyalty levels of 30 customers of a retail store. The info contains rating scores given by these customers and loyalty scores attributed to the customers, calculated from their purchase frequency over a specified period.

This is what we want to achieve: Based on the satisfaction and loyalty scores of this store's customers, segment the customers into appropriate groups and make recommendations to the store owner based on the analyses done. I hope you enjoy my analytic style and the approach I have taken.

Cheers!
